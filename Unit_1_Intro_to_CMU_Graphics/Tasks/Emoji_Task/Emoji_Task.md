5. NOTE: Add something about code comments:

6. NOTE: Add something about design thinking process:
     * [ ] NOTE: Highlight design planner requirement.
     * [ ] NOTE: Highlight version history requirement.
   

## Design Thinking Process

**Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to develop your program.**

1. **Empathize**:
    * [ ] Who is your intended audience?
    * [ ] What are their needs, feelings, and challenges?
    * [ ] In what ways will your emoji meet their needs, feelings, or challenges?

      **Capture your ideas in your design planner**
   
2. **Define**:
    * [ ] Explicitly define the problem with as much detail as possible.
  
      **Capture your ideas in your design planner**

3. **Ideate**:
    * [ ] Brainstorm several ideas for your emoji.
    * [ ] Use written descriptions and/or sketches to bring your ideas to life.
  
       **Capture your ideas in your design planner**

4. **Prototype**:
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
     
5. **Test**:
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.

NOTE: Add reminder to regularly commit, include commit message, and description.
NOTE: Add reminder about 2 peer feedback commits and 1 troubleshooting commit.
NOTE: Add reminders about revisiting other parts of the design thinking process.
