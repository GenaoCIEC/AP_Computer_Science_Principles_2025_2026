## Requirements:

1. Create an emoji that represents you.  It is up to you to determine how...be creative!

2. In your code, call **all** of the following functions:
    * [ ] [Rect()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/rect)
    * [ ] [Circle()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/circle)
    * [ ] [Oval()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/oval)
    * [ ] [Star()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/star)
    * [ ] [Line()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/line)
    * [ ] [Polygon()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/polygon)
    * [ ] [Label()](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/label)

3. In your code, pass arguments to **all** of the following keyword parameters:
    * [ ] fill
    * [ ] border 
    * [ ] borderWidth 
    * [ ] rotateAngle  
    * [ ] roundness 
    * [ ] lineWidth 
    * [ ] size
    * [ ] font
    * [ ] bold 
    * [ ] italic 
          
4. In your code, describe fill in **all** of the following ways:
    * [ ] [Built-In Colors](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/builtInColors)
    * [ ] [RGB Values](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/rgbValues) (Check out the [Google Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+color+picker) for help creating custom colors.)
    * [ ] [Gradient](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs/gradients)
  
5. Thoroughly comment your code in a way that explains and enhances the readability of your code without cluttering it.

6. Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to complete this task
     * [ ] NOTE: Highlight design planner requirement.
     * [ ] NOTE: Highlight version history requirement.

            <b>Version History Matters!</b><br><br>
            ...It helps to document your engagement in the design thinking process.<br>
            ...It gives you the ability to go back to a previous version at any time.<br>
            ...It provides evidence that the work you submit is authentically yours.<br><br>
            <b>Tasks submitted without a <ins>well documented</ins> version history containing <ins>at least 5 versions of your code</ins> and <ins>at least 5 versions of your emoji</ins> will not be accepted.</b>

## Design Thinking Process

**Apply the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process to develop your program.**

1. **Empathize**:
    * [ ] Who is your intended audience?
    * [ ] What are their needs, feelings, and challenges?
    * [ ] In what ways will your emoji meet their needs, feelings, or challenges?

      **Capture your ideas in your design planner**
   
2. **Define**:
    * [ ] Explicitly define the problem with as much detail as possible.
  
      **Capture your ideas in your design planner**

3. **Ideate**:
    * [ ] Brainstorm several ideas for your emoji.
    * [ ] Use written descriptions and/or sketches to bring your ideas to life.
  
       **Capture your ideas in your design planner**

4. **Prototype**:
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
     
5. **Test**:
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.
    * [ ] NOTE: To be completed.

NOTE: Add reminder to regularly commit, include commit message, and description.
NOTE: Add reminder about 2 peer feedback commits and 1 troubleshooting commit.
NOTE: Add reminders about revisiting other parts of the design thinking process.
