## Unit 1, Assignment 7 - Emoji Task Code Comments
Due: TBA

### Emoji Task Code Comments:
1. Navigate to the CMU Graphics [sandbox](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/ide).
2. Open `LastNameFirstInitial_Emoji_Task_Code.py`.
3. Continue prototyping and testing.
4. Use this as an opportunity to add comments to your code.

<table>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Thoroughly comment your code in a way that explains and enhances the readability of your code without cluttering it.
         </td>
      </tr>
   </table>

**Don't be afraid to revisit the Empathize, Define, and Ideate stages of the [design thinking](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Thinking.pdf) process as needed.**

**Capture any updates in your [design planner](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles_2025_2026/blob/main/Resources/Design%20Planner.pdf) and upload them to your Emoji Task folder.**
